## About Me
I'm a full-stack MERN developer with a passion for building scalable web applications. I specialize in TypeScript and have extensive experience with Next.js, creating responsive designs with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and SASS. When I'm not coding, I love diving into books and exploring the latest in AI.
