## About Me
I'm a full-stack MERN developer with a passion for building scalable web applications. I specialize in TypeScript and have extensive experience with Next.js, creating responsive designs with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and SASS. When I'm not coding, I love diving into books and exploring the latest in AI.

## My Thought

### **A Tribute to Open Source**

Open source is not just a development model; it is a philosophy of collaboration and empowerment. My admiration for open source stems from its ability to bring together brilliant minds from across the world to solve problems and innovate without boundaries. It allows knowledge to flow freely and ensures that technology remains accessible to everyone, regardless of their background.

Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, and Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation (and the one who coined the GNU General Public License), are among the most underrated figures in the tech world. Their contributions have laid the foundation for nearly all modern software development. Without their work, the internet as we know it would not exist. Linux powers the servers that drive our world, and the GPL ensures that code remains free and open for everyone to learn from and build upon.

I believe their legacy deserves more recognition, and we, as developers, owe a debt of gratitude to these pioneers. Open source is a reminder that technology is not just about profit; it is about community, creativity, and the shared belief that we can make the world a better place through code.

As a tech tutor, I believe in sharing knowledge and helping others grow. Here are some of the topics I teach:

- **Web Development** with the MERN stack
- **Introduction to AI** with Python
- **Advanced JavaScript** and TypeScript concepts

## Reading List

I'm an avid reader, and here are some of my favorite books:
